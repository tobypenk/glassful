"Nowadays it's typical to order one of these in a bar and be given a glass of something clear and cold—a large, chilled pour of  gin  or, let's face it,  vodka , with nothing in it except a massive olive or three. With all due respect, that's not a martini. That's just cold booze, and there's no shame in ordering that if that's what you want.",1,106,0.14714307,0.8527679,2.4403656e-05,1.5903912e-06,6.299319e-05,https://www.seriouseats.com/the-martini-recipe
"But for at least the first five decades of its circulation, ever since a drink with that name and this general description first appeared around 1900, a martini required vermouth—a lot of it, none of this atomizer business or that stale ""glance in the direction of a vermouth bottle"" hokum. And early on, much of the vermouth making its way into martinis was of the sweet Italian variety rather than French dry—hence, a ""dry martini"" was a drink made with dry vermouth, not one with as little vermouth as possible.",1,107,0.012245174,0.98014426,2.7027388e-06,5.134131e-05,0.007556594,https://www.seriouseats.com/the-martini-recipe
"Bar guides and newspaper descriptions published through the 1940s and into the 1950s described martinis as a mixture of two parts gin, one part vermouth, many times with a dash of orange bitters (don't knock it 'til you've tried it) and a lemon twist, and there were variations on the theme, with differing proportions and styles of vermouth. It wasn't until the Mad Men era that the less-is-better approach to vermouth really started catching on.",0,108,0.98949,0.010502973,2.1093579e-06,5.840997e-07,4.357793e-06,https://www.seriouseats.com/the-martini-recipe
"In  The Hour , a cocktail manifesto by Bernard DeVoto, first published in 1951 (a new edition was released last month), this legendary curmudgeon describes his ideal martini as a 3.7:1 ratio of gin to vermouth, a proportion that would be considered drowning in the aperitif by today's standards but at the time was the cutting edge of dryness in the drink.",1,109,0.1012965,0.8982773,1.0885892e-05,7.973534e-05,0.00033562182,https://www.seriouseats.com/the-martini-recipe

If you prefer your martini with only the merest whiff of vermouth, then go for it, or if you like it up to equal parts gin and vermouth, there's a firm historical foundation (not to mention a culinary one) for going that direction.",0,110,0.90655607,0.09337982,4.337613e-06,5.1224906e-05,8.575486e-06,https://www.seriouseats.com/the-martini-recipe
